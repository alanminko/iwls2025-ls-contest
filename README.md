## Problems and Results of IWLS 2025 Programming Contest

This repository contains the benchmarks of [IWLS 2025](https://www.iwls.org/iwls2025/) 
Programming Contest and the circuits produced by the participants.

The goal of the contest was to synthesize [AIGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And-inverter_graph) 
with the minimal number of two-input and-nodes (AIGs) 
for two sets of completely-specified multi-output Boolean functions 
represented using truth tables. The AIGs for both sets of benchmarks were submited in [binary AIGER format](http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/).
For the detailed information about the rules and evaluation criteria, please refer to 
this year's [contest description](https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2025-ls-contest/blob/main/IWLS_2025_Programming_Contest.pdf).

The contest was organized by Alan Mishchenko and Alessandro Tempia Calvino (IWLS 2025 Contest Chairs)

### Benchmarks

The [benchmarks](https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2025-ls-contest/tree/main/benchmarks) available in this repository include 200 functions.

The first set of 100 functions is the same set that appeared in the IWLS 2022 competition. The second set of 100 functions are new functions generated 
specifically for this contest.

Please refer to the [results presentation](https://github.com/alanminko/iwls2025-ls-contest/blob/main/IWLS_2025_Contest_Presentation.pdf) for the details on the benchmarks.

Despite the original intention to release the Verilog source code of the benchmarks, it was decided to postpone the release,
because the same test-cases may be used again in future competitions.
